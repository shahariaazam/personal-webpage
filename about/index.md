From the age of 14, I wished to develop a website that likes of Yahoo!, Google . The reason is that I use these website’s feature a great deal. Google impresses me as it is an opportunity to bring the world much closer , and from this I am aiming and thinking how I too may play many part in this wonderful world. Prior to now, I have studied in Dhaka College in B.Sc in Mathematics. But mathematics is not my true passion.
